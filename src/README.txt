This is a simple version of tetris. The seven classic tetris pieces fall
and can be controlled. When all switches are off, pressing the button
will rotate the current piece counter-clockwise. When the left-most
switch is on, pressing the button will push the piece a step to the left.
When the right-most switch is on, pushing the button will push the piece
a step to the left.

Compiling and running the program:

Navigate to the folder and run the "make" command. Make sure the dtek-v board
is connected to the computer and that a monitor is connected to the dtek-v boards
VGA-output. Download the dtekv-tools and use dtekv-run on the main.bin file that
is created after compiling with "make".

This was created by Vilmer Palm√©r and Rocco Molero. The dtek lab 3 code was
as recommended used as a base. The files which we have created or modified will
have a comment at the top which explains who wrote or modified that code.
Some functions are exceptions where we both worked on them at the same time,
this is clearly stated in a comment above the function.
